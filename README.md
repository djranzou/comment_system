# Comments System
Simple comment system with bad words filter and basic MVC structured pages - PHP, MySQL, JS

### Notes:
1) I wasn't planning to make a spamlist page, since the test was to see 
if matching keywords triggers the statement and sends the bad comments to spam list table.
So spam list page is very basic, and I haven't use global DB conection, found an example on w3s and used it.

2) I thought of making comment module more mobile like, so it's easy to emplement it to other pages by including it's function class
